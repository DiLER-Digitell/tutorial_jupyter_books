# Recap 

Congratulations, you are at the end of our course **Creating interactive content with Jupyter Books**.

In this course, we focused on helping you achieve the following key goals:

* Create content with markdown
* Create your own online course or website using Jupyter Book
* Host courses using GitHub Pages

Therefore, in the GitHub chapter, you learned the benefits of using GitHub, how to set up your GitHub account, and how to create your first online repository using our course template.

Next, you learned how to host your course website using GitHub Pages and how to troubleshoot common error warnings.

Finally, you explored the types of files you can integrate into your Jupyter Book and how to create them. You also learned the basics of formatting with Markdown, how to embed various media types, and how to include citations and feedback questions. Last but not least, you learned how to structure your course website with the table of contents file (_toc.yml).

What is left to say is that we wish you a lot of fun while creating your first course website and to fill the pages. If you need any advice or consultation, please feel free to contact us. You will find our contact information here: {doc}`../../intro/overview`.
