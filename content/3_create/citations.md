# Adding Citations and Bibliographies

If you want to include citations into your course website, you first need to create a bibtext file, in which the information of your citations are stored in. 

## Create a Bibliography

Add a new file to your repository and use the `.bib` suffix to create a bibtex file.

Then, add your references to the file:

## Add a Citation
Now, you can include your citations into your text. Here is an example:

```
{cite}`munafo2017manifesto`
```

Result:
{cite}`munafo2017manifesto`
